	Dark Souls 2 Legit Trainer
		by applusplus
	Easy to use and legit 
	Only for Steam version!

Use it on your own risk! I assume no liability!
I am using it since the second day after the release and I am still good standing!

How To Use:
1. Start Dark Souls 2
2. Go ingame.
3. Start the Trainer.
4. Use the features. (Read information from below)
5. You can switch between the trainer and the game with ALT+TAB 
6. Done. :D

Items information:
1. Be careful with "freeze" and "reverse" functions on items, they can prevent you to get bought items or loot!
2. "no consume" and "reverse consume" functions works only with a stack of two or more items!

General information:
- Value "-1" means that the value couldn't be read.
- Legit means that there are no functions that can attract attention on your character, like stats manipulation!
